This is a code snippet app that takes plain text and applies syntax highlighting and formatting based on the language. The user can log in and out, save and delete as well as update code snippets.

Technologies used:

* Python
* Javascript / jQuery
* SQL
* Flask
* Bootstrap
* HTML/CSS
* AJAX - In Progress

This was made from scratch by myself with some molular functionality imported from open libraries. Ajax is currently being added.
